# Prebuilt Releases
You can download prebuilt releases (Windows only at the moment) from the [Releases](https://github.com/HipsterSloth/PSVRTracker/releases) page. Then follow the initial setup instructions found in the [wiki](https://github.com/HipsterSloth/PSVRTracker/wiki#initial-setup). 

# Building from source
If you want to make modifications to the service or want to debug it, you can build the project from source by following the  [Building-from-source](https://github.com/cboulay/PSMoveService/wiki/Building-from-source) instructions. Currently supported build platforms are Win10 and OS X with Linux support hopefully coming in the near future.

# Documentation

# Usage in other projects
Feel free to use this code as-is, modified or adapted in other projects (commercial or otherwise). It's intended to be a reference algorithm that I hope other can make use of in any way they see fit.
