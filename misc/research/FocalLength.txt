 pixel size: 6.0µm x 6.0µm <- trust this value

If you know the sensor's physical width in mm, then the focal in pixels is:

  focal_length_px = (focal_length_mm / sensor_width_mm) * image_width_px
  
  => focal_length_mm= focal_length_px * (sensor_width_mm / image_width_px)
  => Note: sensor_pixel_size = (sensor_width_mm / image_width_px)

And if you know the horizontal field of view, say in degrees,

  focal_length_px = 0.5 * image_width_px / tan(0.5 * fov_radians)

554.2563px * 0.006px/mm = 3.33 mm
604.1784px * 0.006px/mm = 3.63 mm

aspect_ratio= image_pixel_height / image_pixel_width
image_sensor_width_mm = sensor_pixel_size * image_width_px
focal_length_x_mm = 0.5 * image_sensor_width_mm / tan(0.5 * fov_radians);
focal_length_y_mm = 0.5 * image_sensor_height_mm / tan(0.5 * fov_radians*aspect_ratio);

The horizontal FOV of the PS3 Eye is:
- 56degrees (red dot) for close up framing
- 76degrees (blue dot) for long shot framing 
focal_length_x_mm = 0.5 * (0.006px/mm * 800 diagonal px)/ tan(0.5 * 76degrees) = 3.07mm

Object height on sensor (mm) / focal length (f, mm) = Real Object height (feet) / Distance to Object (d, feet)

focal_length_mm / (distance to object in mm) = (object length in pixels) * (pixel size in mm) / (object length in mm)

=> This is also true since focal_length_mm = focal_length_px * pixel size in mm
focal_length_px / (distance to object in mm) = (object length in pixels) / (object length in mm)

The horizontal field of view of many webcams and cell phones is 50 to 70 degrees.
=> 0.7*image_width_px <= focal_length_px <= image_width_px
=> Often field of view specs are the diagonal FOV
